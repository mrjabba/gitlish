# Gitlish (Github favorites + Delicous bookmarks = gitlish)

This is a script that will export your gitub favorites and import them into your delicious.com account.

It will tag them with "gitlish". 

How do I use this thing?

- Checkout the project.

- ruby run_gitlish.rb github_username delicious_username, delicious_password

That's it. Enhancements and ideas welcome. Please fork. I would love to have tags for favorites in github.

NOTE: rdelicious.is_connected? does not seem to be working. So make sure you get your password correct.
